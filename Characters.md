## Card
Characters are based on Cards.
Each Card is a Move or an Attribute.
For instance: 
- **Orc Strength** is an Attribute that gives the character the strength of an Orc.
- **Longbow** is a Move that allows the character to attack with a longbow.

Each character gets 
- all Basic Cards
- 1 Lineage Bundle
- and the cards in their Class Bundle depending on their level.

Characters can collect cards along their adventures, in the form of experiences, items, and skills.
At the end of each session, each character decides on what experience, item, or skill they want to be made into a card.
The game master will then give them that card before the next game starts.
## Stats
Characters' base abilities are based on Stats.
Each character has a base of 0 on all stats except for HP and Level.
Everyone's HP is at a base of 15.
Everyone's Level starts at 1.

When a character takes a day to rest, their HP returns to normal.
Specifically, it goes to Base (15) + Each HP Attribute Bonus.
## Leveling Up
Characters have an EXP stat that they can use to level up.
Characters have different ways on gaining EXP, but all of them have these basic ways:
- Gain 1 EXP when you survive a battle.
- Gain 1 EXP when you end a session after saving people from certain doom.
- Gain 1 EXP when you end a session after someone on your team did something awesome.

| Level | EXP Required |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1     | 0            |
| 2     | 4            |
| 3     | 6            |
| 4     | 8            |
| 5     | 10           |
| 6     | 12           |
| 7     | 14           |
In order to level up, the character must spend the amount of EXP required.
The amount of EXP required is on the *table above.*
Characters can only level up 1 level at a time.
To level up from 2 to 3, the character must spend 6 EXP.
