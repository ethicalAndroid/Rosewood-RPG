The base system of combat is this:
## Battle
Each Team has a bunch of Battlers.
Teams take turns attacking back and forth, with the Battler holding their Team's Initiative taking their turn.
At the end of a Battler's turn, they pass the Initiative to another Battler in their team.
Then, the next Team will take their turn.
**Battler**
	A PC or NPC that is capable and ready for battle.
**Team**
	A team of Battlers that are on the same side.
**Initiative**
	A token that indicates who on the Team will act next.
**Turn**
	A measure of time that a Battler or Team can act in.
	When a Team takes its turn, then the Battler with the Initiative takes their turn.
	After that Battler's turn is over, then they pass the Initiative to another Battler on their team.
	If there are no other Battlers left in their team, then they keep the Initiative.

Each team takes turns until the Battle is over.
A Battle is over when all but 1 Team is Out.
That team wins the Battle.

**Out**
	When a Battler Surrenders, Flees, is Defeated.
	A Team is Out when all of its Battlers are Out.
**Surrender**
	When a Battler stops fighting by choice.
**Flee**
	When a Battler completely exits the Battle.
**Defeat**
	When a Battler can no longer fight.
## Damage and HP
In a Battle, each Battler has HP (hit-points).
This is how much damage they can take before they are defeated.
HP can be seen as "endurance", "exhaustion", "blood", "connection", or "morale". It all depends on the character.
## Turn
When a Battler takes their turn, they gain 3 AP to spend on moves.
After they run out of AP, or whenever they decide, they can end their turn.
After they end their turn, they pass the Initiative to another Team member.
If there are no Team members available to pass the Initiative to, then the Battler must pass the Initiative to themself.
